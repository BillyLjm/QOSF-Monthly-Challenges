# QOSF Monthly Challenges
These are the solutions I submitted for the QOSF monthly challanges  
The original repo with all the materials can be found at [/qosf/monthly-challenges](https://github.com/qosf/monthly-challenges)   

## Description  
Each monthly challenge is separated in its own `challange-xx` folder.  
And the solutions are coded in `qosf-monthly-challenge-xx.ipynb` in the folders.
